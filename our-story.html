                                        perceived as her strengths and what they
                                        thought she could focus on improving.
                                        The resultant feedback took her by
                                        surprise. She discovered her many hidden
                                        strengths as well as improvement
                                        opportunities. She chose to remind
                                        herself of the former to buttress her
                                        self-belief and took steps to redress
                                        the latter.</p>

                                    <p>around the same time, the Tata Group

                                        fortunate to be selected in the 1st few
                                        batches of SCIP, where co-incidentally
                                        and interestingly the project she was
                                        offered, was an assignment in the sector
                                        she had started her career in initially,
                                        the hospitality sector.
                                        Since then, she has not looked back. It
                                        was during her tenure with the Taj Group
                                        of Hotels that she did another
                                        self-assessment and realized that the
                                        area of human resources where she had
                                        most enjoyed working and had had maximum
                                        impact was in the space of organisation
                                        and leadership development, and that’s
                                        the area that she decided to specialise
                                        in her 2nd innings.</p>
