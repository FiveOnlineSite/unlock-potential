                                    <p>Sentiments similar to these have been
                                        echoed time and again by many of the
                                        people I have had the privilege of
                                        working with, during the course of my
                                        work as an Executive Coach and a
                                        Leadership Development Consultant. If
                                        you too consider talking about yourself
                                        and your accomplishments as an
                                        inherently distasteful thing to do, then
                                        you are not alone! Many people view this
                                        as boasting or ‘game playing’. To them,
                                        it is exceedingly important that their
                                        work be the biggest thing that speaks
                                        for them, underpinned by a belief that
                                        taking efforts to create visibility for
                                        themselves is unnecessary; a waste of
                                        personal time, organizational resources
                                        and quite frankly beneath them. Such
                                        people often operate with an assumption
                                        that those who indulge in what they see
                                        as ‘politics’ need to do so, as perhaps
                                        the latter’s work lacks substance and
                                        therefore this ‘people pleasing
                                        behaviour’ is in essence a cover up for
                                        their performance inadequacies.

                                    <p>So, what happens to them when faced with
                                        their more politically savvy
                                        counterparts? During my conversations I
                                        have seen reactions range from; a sense
                                        of disbelief – how can people actually
                                        stoop to playing such games, to ‘can’t
                                        the world see this guy is a fake’, to a
                                        sense of resignation – okay let those
                                        who want to do all this do it, I will
                                        focus even harder on my work and my
                                        results will show everyone.</p>

                                                    <p>There are various ways in one which one can build their personal brand. The journey towards defining what do I want to be known for, begins with honest self-reflection on one’s values, principles, priorities and dreams. Seeking feedback from trusted sources on one’s unique strengths is helpful in the process of introspection. Often times the findings of an external assessment can also highlight one’s distinctive qualities. Collectively, these can be some ways to arrive at one’s own brand persona. In addition, experts suggest using social media mindfully such that the messages or views one shares across platforms are in sync with one’s brand. Furthermore, giving back to the community through sharing knowledge and skills is another thing that helps create positive recall for an individual.

                                                            In his seminal work, Sources of Power, Gary Klein talks of 5 kinds of power. In connection with our theme of influence and creating a personal brand, one way of building opinion in your favour can be to establish your expertise in an area such that you are seen as the ‘go-to’ resource in that domain. Another way to create visibility can be to increase your Referent Power. This comes from cultivating interpersonal relationships with people in the organization such that they see you as someone they trust, admire and respect and this in turn ups your ability to wield influence.
